# GitFlix

**Every repository has a story worth telling.**

GitFlix turns any public GitHub repository into a cinematic documentary, complete with animated scenes, commit analytics, a generated narrative and a full soundtrack. Paste a URL, pick a tone and watch your codebase come alive on screen.

## What it does

GitFlix analyses a repository's commit history and produces a seven-scene short film:

| Scene | Title | What it shows |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| S01 | The Origin | When and by whom the project began |
| S02 | The Cast | The top contributors and their commit share |
| S03 | The Rise | A live-animated donut chart of commit distribution |
| S04 | The Plot Twist | The single most dramatic week of activity |
| S05 | Ghost Towns | Files that have not been touched in over 180 days |
| S06 | The Hero Moment | The one commit that changed the most lines |
| S07 | The Finale | Final statistics and a closing card |

Each scene has fade transitions, per-scene subtitles and a background score that fades out cleanly at the end.

## Tech stack

**Backend**
- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) — REST API and Server-Sent Events streaming
- [PyGitHub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/) — GitHub data ingestion
- [LangChain + Groq](https://python.langchain.com/) — LLM-powered narration via `llama-3.1-8b-instant`
- [Pydantic v2](https://docs.pydantic.dev/) — typed data schemas throughout

**Frontend**
- [React 19](https://react.dev/) + [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) + [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [Remotion 4](https://www.remotion.dev/) — programmatic video rendered in the browser
- [Space Grotesk + Inter](https://fonts.google.com/) — typography

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- A GitHub personal access token (for the GitHub API)
- A Groq API key (for LLM narration)

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gitflix.git
cd gitflix
```

### 2. Set up the backend

```bash
cd backend
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:

```env
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

Start the API server:

```bash
uv run uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 3. Set up the frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the `frontend/` directory:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in your browser.

## Usage

1. Enter a public GitHub repository URL, e.g. `https://github.com/MoSahil147/GitFlix`
2. Select a tone — **Epic**, **Documentary**, or **Casual**
3. Click **Generate Film**
4. Watch the progress bar as the backend fetches data, runs analytics, and writes the script
5. The film plays automatically once ready — use the chapter strip below the player to jump between scenes

## API reference

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/generate/stream` | Streams SSE progress events, then delivers the full script on completion |
| `POST` | `/generate` | Runs the full pipeline and returns the script as JSON (no streaming) |
| `POST` | `/generate/cancel` | Cancels an in-progress generation |
| `GET` | `/status` | Health check — returns `ok` or `degraded` with missing config details |

> **Note for contributors:** This endpoint is intentionally named `/status` and not `/health`. Browser-based ad blockers silently block requests to URLs containing the word `health` (treating them as tracking or analytics calls) before the request ever leaves the browser. This caused the frontend to report the backend as unreachable even when the server was running perfectly — no backend logs, no CORS error, just a silent client-side block. Renaming to `/status` fixed it immediately.

### SSE event shape

```json
{ "stage": "ingestion", "pct": 5,   "msg": "Fetching repo data…" }
{ "stage": "analytics", "pct": 30,  "msg": "Analysing commit history…" }
{ "stage": "agent",     "pct": 55,  "msg": "Writing the script…" }
{ "stage": "done",      "pct": 100, "data": { ...ScriptJSON } }
```

## Environment variables

| Variable | Where | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | `backend/.env` | GitHub API access (avoids rate limiting) |
| `GROQ_API_KEY` | `backend/.env` | LLM narration via Groq |
| `VITE_API_URL` | `frontend/.env` | Backend base URL (defaults to `http://localhost:8000`) |

---

## Deployment

The backend is a standard ASGI app and can be deployed to any platform that supports Python — Render, Railway, Fly.io, etc.

The frontend builds to a static site (`npm run build`) and can be deployed to Vercel, Netlify, or any static host.

If deploying behind nginx, ensure SSE is not buffered:

```nginx
proxy_buffering off;
proxy_cache off;
```

The backend already sends `X-Accel-Buffering: no` and `Cache-Control: no-cache` headers for Render compatibility.
