    # Sort oldest commit first so timeseries math works correctly
    commits_df = commits_df.sort_values("timestamp")

    # ── PART 2: Weekly commit timeseries + spike detection ───────────────────
    # Used by: S03 (The Rise) — the animated bar chart that grows over time
    #          S04 (The Plot Twist) — the spike week is the dramatic moment

    # Set timestamp as the DataFrame index so pandas can group by time periods
    commits_df.set_index("timestamp", inplace=True)

    # resample("W") buckets every commit into its calendar week (week-ending Sunday)
    # .count() counts how many commits landed in each bucket
    # reset_index() brings "week" back as a normal column (not the index)

    # ── SPIKE DETECTION using the 2-SIGMA (2 standard deviation) RULE ──────────
    #
    # MEAN  = the average number of commits per week across the whole repo history.
    #         This is our "baseline" — what a normal week looks like.
    #
    # STD   = the standard deviation — measures how much week-to-week commit counts
    #         SPREAD AROUND the mean. A high std means the repo is bursty;
    #         a low std means it's steady and predictable.
    mean = weekly["count"].mean()
    std  = weekly["count"].std()

    # WHY 2 * STD (2σ)?
    #   In a roughly NORMAL distribution, ~95% of values fall within mean ± 2σ.
    #   So anything ABOVE mean + 2σ is in the top ~2.5% — genuinely unusual.
    #
    #   • 1.5σ threshold → too SENSITIVE, flags many ordinary busy weeks as spikes.
    #   • 3σ threshold   → too STRICT, only catches truly extreme outliers, misses
    #                       real dramatic moments in most repos.
    #   • 2σ is the SWEET SPOT: "unusual but not once-in-a-lifetime."
    #
    # EDGE CASE — LOW-VARIANCE REPOS (e.g. exactly 1 commit every week for years):
    #   std ≈ 0, so mean + 2*std ≈ mean.
    #   Any week with even 2 commits becomes a spike.
    #   This is CORRECT BEHAVIOUR — any burst IS genuinely anomalous for that repo.
    #
    # ASSUMPTION: This heuristic assumes commit counts are ROUGHLY NORMALLY DISTRIBUTED.
    #   In practice they are RIGHT-SKEWED (one big launch week pulls the mean up).
    #   A more robust alternative would use MEDIAN + IQR instead of mean + std,
    #   since median is not affected by outliers.
    weekly["is_spike"] = weekly["count"] > (mean + 2 * std)

    # → this becomes commit_series in the final return, fed into S03 visual_params
